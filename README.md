## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.


A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

## Conclusions
<font color = red >

>### Temperature: Most important factor affecting demand is temperature. With a coefficient of 0.5502, for every change in temperature of 1 degrees, demand increases by a factor of 0.5502 (temperature x 0.5502). Based on this, company will have to consider:Necessary capacity building during hotter months to fulfil the demand

    
>### Light snow: Second most important factor is Light Rain or Snow with a coefficient of (-0.2848) Hence, if a particular day has light rains, it is expected to reduce the demand by 28.48%. Based on this, itis recommended to develop a sentiment based advertisement plan that heavily promotes fun element of the riding bikes in rain.

>### Year: Third most important factor is year with a coefficient value of 0.2365. Based on the historical data, given all internal and external factors remain unchanged, the company is expected to see annual growth over last year at around 23.65%.This helps us in factoring teh revenue and cost projections over a period of time.

>### Winter: Fourth most important factor is winter with a coefficient of 0.1319. Tihs signifies that every winter, the demand is expecteed to incerase by a factor of 0.1319 basd on other months.From the available data, Winter season constitutes of Sep, Oct, Nov and December months.Company needs to work on capacity planing of these months and additionally plan for promotional campaigns in case a competitors exist with similar value propositions

>## Train and Test R2 Score is 82.6%
